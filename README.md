- 👋 Hi, I’m @SepidehFaghihi a PhD candidate at Toronto Metropolitan (Formerly Ryerson) University.
- 👀 I am a spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) researcher with a primary interest on developing intelligent control systems for real-world aerospace applications.
- My doctoral research at focuses on spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control for on-orbit proximity operations during space exploration missions.
- 💞️ I developed new algorithms for optimal close proximity on-orbit inspection of large space structures. I created optimal inspection motion planners for a single and a swarm of multiple spacecraft to perform an accurate and complete inspection. I have also made contributions to formulating the collision avoidance constraint for autonomous on-orbit assembly applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning approaches and their application in space robotics as I am also interested in studying and advancing artificial intelligence technologies for space applications.
